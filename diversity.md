Diversity and Inclusion
=======================

The Dask developer community welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.
Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we
are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our
community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we
welcome you.
