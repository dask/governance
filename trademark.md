Dask Trademark Policy
=====================

This document describes the policy governing the use of the "Dask" trademark,
which is owned by NumFOCUS and administered on behalf of the Dask project.  Any
use of the Dask trademark commercially or non-commercially must be in
accordance with the policy described in this document unless specific written
permission is obtained from NumFOCUS.

Usage and modification of the Dask *software* is governed by the
[license](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), which describes
permissible behavior under copyright law.  Trademarks are a distinct form of
intellectual property, and so the guidelines in this document apply only to
the "Dask" trademark and logo, but not to the software itself.

Intent
------

Our goal is to enable the Dask trademark and logo to be used with minimal
restrictions by both commercial and non-commercial entities, but we do *not*
want the Dask trademark to be used:

* to cause confusion about whether a project, product, or service is endorsed
  by the Dask community in some way.
* in a way that allows an entity to misleadingly imply ownership of Dask or
  influence over the Dask project.

Permissible usage
-----------------

The Dask trademark is always subject to "nominative use rules" which allow the
usage of the trademark for descriptive purposes that does not suggest
sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner.  You may freely describe
that your product or service "uses Dask" or is "powered by Dask," and you
may use the unaltered Dask logo to indicate this without prior approval.
(Please see the [Dask Brand Guide](https://www.dask.org/brand-guide) for more
details about how to use the Dask logo.)

Open source projects may also use the Dask name as part of the name of their
project (Ex: `dask-cuda`) so long as it satisfies *all* the following
criteria:

* The project is open source with a liberal license.
* The project is related to Dask.
* The project name should not be overly grand in claiming namespace.
* The project should not make subjective claims in the name itself.

Usage of the "Dask" trademark should also be consistent with the [Dask Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dask/governance/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

Non-permissible usage
---------------------

The Dask trademark may *not* be used in a commercial product or company name.  Examples of disallowed uses include:

* Dask Pro
* Dask Enterprise
* The Dask Company
* CompanyName Dask

Company and product logos may not derive from the Dask logo in a way that would cause brand confusion.

Where to get more information
-----------------------------

If you are unsure whether your planned usage of the Dask trademark is allowed,
or feel that you need specific written approval for your situation, please
contact the Dask maintainers at info@dask.org.
